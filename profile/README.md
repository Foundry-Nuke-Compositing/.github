## What is Foundry Nuke?

**Foundry Nuke** is an industry-leading, node-based digital compositing software widely used in film, television, and advertising for creating high-quality visual effects (VFX). It offers a powerful, flexible, and highly efficient environment for compositors, artists, and studios to integrate computer-generated imagery (CGI) with live-action footage.

With Foundry Nuke, professionals can:
- Seamlessly combine multiple layers of images, video, and CGI.
- Work in a non-destructive, node-based workflow.
- Handle complex compositing tasks with precision.
- Support 2D and 3D environments within the same project.

Its robust toolset includes advanced keying, rotoscoping, tracking, and deep image compositing, making it the go-to software for blockbuster movies and high-end TV productions. Whether you're working on character integration, environmental effects, or full CG scenes, Nuke provides the capabilities needed to achieve photorealistic results.

Nuke’s scalability and integration with other software like Maya, Houdini, and Photoshop make it an essential tool for modern VFX pipelines. It is trusted by major studios such as Industrial Light & Magic, Weta Digital, and DNEG.
